# blakes_clothing_pricing_strategies
In case I ever launch my own men's fashion brand someday and want machine learning and data science to lead the way.

## Summary
I love the idea of having my own brand someday (hey, I can dream).  One common task for all businesses and industries is pricing strategies.  They vary based on a plethora of circumstances, parameters, and industries.  In this repo, I show you some common pricing strategies, when to use them, and when NOT to.

I also include my own code to show synthetic data to simulate pricing strategies based on my hypothetical company's data, including our inventory, product prices, current campaigns and discounts we're running, invoices, and order history.  Using this code, I create some machine learning strategies to give my company the best pricing strategies available.  It might be synthetic data today, but it could be real data tomorrow.

As always, suggestions, comments, concerns, and questions are always welcome.  Thanks for looking at my work!
